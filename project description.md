## Time-Based and Demographic Sales Analysis

### Intended Purpose

The intended purpose of this Python script is to perform data analysis on transaction and demographic data, specifically focusing on time-based and demographic analyses, and to store the results in a local database. This involves creating connections to a local database, data manipulation, generating visualizations, and storing the results.

### Key Objectives

1. **Database Connection**: Establish a connection to a local database using SQLAlchemy.
2. **Time-Based Analysis**: Analyze sales data over time.
3. **Demographic Analysis**: Analyze sales data based on demographic attributes.
4. **Product Demographic Analysis**: Analyze product sales data by demographic attributes.
5. **Data Storage**: Store the results of the analysis in a local database and export to flat files.

### Section Objectives

1. **Database Connection**
   - **Objective**: Create a connection to the local database using SQLAlchemy.

2. **Time-Based Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Perform time-based analysis of sales data.
   - **Reading Data**: Read `project_transactions.csv` file into a DataFrame.
   - **Creating Date Index**: Convert `DAY` column to date and set as index.
   - **Sales Over Time**: Plot the sum of sales by month and compare sales between 2016 and 2017.
   - **Sales by Weekday**: Plot total sales by day of the week.
   - 
3. **Demographic Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Analyze sales data based on demographic attributes.
   - **Reading Data**: Read `hh_demographic.csv` file into a DataFrame.
   - **Group by Household**: Calculate the sum of sales by household.
   - **Join with Demographics**: Merge sales data with demographic data.
   - **Plotting**: Plot sum of sales by `AGE_DESC` and `INCOME_DESC`.
   - **Handling Missing Data**: Drop rows with missing values in relevant columns.
   - **Create New Columns**: Define conditions and create new columns for age, income, and homeowner status.
   - **Convert to Numeric**: Convert new columns to numeric, coercing errors to NaN.
   - **Drop NaN Values**: Drop rows with NaN values in new columns.
   - **Scatter Plot**: Create a scatter plot based on the new columns.
   - **Pivot Table**: Create a pivot table of mean household sales by `AGE_DESC` and `HH_COMP_DESC`.
   - **Heatmap**: Generate and save a heatmap of the pivot table.

4. **Product Demographic Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Analyze product sales data by demographic attributes.
   - **Reading Data**: Read `product.csv` file into a DataFrame.
   - **Join DataFrames**: Join product data with transaction and demographic data.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Replace missing values in `DEPARTMENT` and fill NaN values in `SALES_VALUE`.
   - **Pivot Table**: Create a pivot table of sales by `AGE_DESC` and `DEPARTMENT`.
   - **Heatmap**: Generate and save a heatmap of the pivot table.

5. **Data Storage**
   - **Objective**: Store the results of the analysis in a local database and export to flat files.
   - **Database Storage**: Store merged data into the local database.
   - **Export to Excel**: Export the pivot table to an Excel file.
   - **Export to CSV**: Export the pivot table to a CSV file.
 
### Key Takeaways

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: The script covers both time-based and demographic analyses, providing insights into sales trends and demographic patterns.
- **Memory Optimization**: Data types are optimized for memory efficiency during the data reading process.
- **Interim Verification Steps**: Print statements and plots are included to verify intermediate results, ensuring accuracy at each step.
- **Use of Visualizations**: The script uses visualizations to convey the results of the analysis effectively.
- **Data Storage**: The script includes functionality to store the results in a database and export to flat files, ensuring that the analysis can be saved and shared easily.
